    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Korean Fried Chicken, known for its crispy texture and flavorful coating, is a popular dish that combines the crunch of fried chicken with a unique, tangy, and spicy glaze. The chicken is double-fried, which gives it an extra-crispy exterior while keeping the meat juicy and tender. After frying, the chicken is tossed in a sticky sauce made from a blend of gochujang (Korean chili paste), soy sauce, garlic, ginger, honey, and vinegar, creating a perfect balance of sweetness, heat, and umami. Often garnished with sesame seeds and served with pickled radishes or a cold beer, Korean Fried Chicken offers an irresistible combination of textures and flavors that make it a standout in the world of fried chicken dishes.</p>

    <h3>Steps to cook</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.</li>
        <li>Gradually add cold water to the dry ingredients, stirring until a smooth batter forms.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350째F (175째C).</li>
        <li>Dip each piece of chicken into the batter, ensuring it is fully coated.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken for about 8-10 minutes until lightly golden, then remove and drain on a wire rack or paper towels.</li>
        <li>After all the chicken pieces have been fried once, increase the oil temperature to 375째F (190째C).</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken a second time for an additional 3-5 minutes until golden brown and extra crispy.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is frying, prepare the sauce by combining gochujang, soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, minced garlic, grated ginger, and sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Toss the hot, double-fried chicken in the prepared sauce until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Garnish the chicken with sesame seeds and chopped green onions if desired.</li>
