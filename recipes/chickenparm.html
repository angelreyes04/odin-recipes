    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Chicken Parmesan is a classic Italian-American dish featuring breaded chicken breasts, lightly fried to a golden brown, and then smothered in a rich tomato sauce and melted mozzarella cheese. The chicken is first coated in a mixture of breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese, adding a savory crunch to each bite. After frying, the chicken is topped with marinara sauce and slices of mozzarella before being baked until the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. This hearty dish is often served over a bed of spaghetti or alongside a simple green salad, making for a comforting and satisfying meal.
