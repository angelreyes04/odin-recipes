    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a comforting and hearty Italian dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella. The recipe begins with preparing a savory meat sauce, typically made with ground beef or sausage, sautéed with onions and garlic, and simmered in a flavorful tomato sauce seasoned with Italian herbs. A creamy layer of ricotta cheese, often mixed with eggs and Parmesan, adds a velvety texture to the dish. The lasagna is assembled by layering the cooked pasta sheets with alternating layers of meat sauce, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella cheese, then baked until bubbly and golden brown. The result is a deliciously satisfying dish, perfect for feeding a crowd or enjoying as leftovers.</p>
